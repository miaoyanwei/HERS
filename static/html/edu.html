        <h1 style="width:60%; color:#345A46; margin-top: 24px;">Why we should take climate change seriously and turn to renewable energy?</h1>
        <h2>What is global warming?</h2>
        <p style="width:60%;">Global warming refers to the long-term rise in earth's average surface temperature, which is largely attributed to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space, leading to a gradual warming of the planet.</p>
        <h2>What are the causes of global warming?</h2>
        <p style="width:60%;">Human activities are the primary cause of global warming, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy. Deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <h2>What damages have caused by global warming?</h2>
        <p style="width:60%;">Global warming has a range of negative impacts on the environment, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, floods, and storms, and the loss of biodiversity. These changes can lead to the displacement of human populations, food and water scarcity, and increased risks to public health.</p>
        <h2>What is the goal to address global warming?</h2>
        <p style="width:60%;">The EU has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this goal, EU countries are implementing a range of policies and measures to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
        <h2>How to prevent or slow down global warming as citizens and consumers?</h2>
        <p style="width:60%;">As citizens and consumers, there are many actions that we can take to help prevent or slow down global warming. Here are some key ways that you can make a difference:</p>
        <p style="width:60%;"><b>Reduce energy use:</b> One of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions is the energy we use in our daily lives, from heating and cooling our homes to driving our cars. To reduce your energy use, consider:</p>
        <li>Turning off lights and electronics when not in use</li>
        <li>Using energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs</li>
        <li>Lowering your thermostat in the winter and raising it in the summer</li>
        <li>Walking, biking, or taking public transit instead of driving</li>
        <li>Carpooling or using ride-sharing services when possible</li>
        <li>Investing in an electric or hybrid vehicle</li><br>
        <p style="width:60%;"><b>Conserve water:</b> Another important way to reduce your carbon footprint is to conserve water. This can be done by:</p>
        <li>Fixing leaky faucets and pipes</li>
        <li>Using low-flow showerheads and toilets</li>
        <li>Watering your lawn and garden less frequently</li>
        <li>Collecting rainwater for outdoor use</li>
        <li>Only running the dishwasher and washing machine when they are full</li><br>
        <p style="width:60%;"><b>Reduce waste:</b> Landfills are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. To reduce your waste, consider:</p>
        <li>Recycling and composting as much as possible</li>
        <li>Using reusable bags, water bottles, and containers instead of disposable ones</li>
        <li>Buying products with minimal packaging</li>
        <li>Donating or selling unwanted items instead of throwing them away</li><br>
        <p style="width:60%;"><b>Support renewable energy:</b> Choosing to support renewable energy sources can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a more sustainable energy system. Consider:</p>
        <li>Installing solar panels on your home or property</li>
        <li>Choosing a green energy provider for your electricity</li>
        <li>Supporting policies and regulations that encourage renewable energy development</li><br>
        <p style="width:60%;"><b>Advocate for change:</b> As a citizen, you can make a difference by advocating for change at the local, national, and international level. This might include:</p>
        <li>Voting for political leaders who prioritize climate action</li>
        <li>Writing to your elected officials to express your concerns and priorities</li>
        <li>Supporting advocacy groups and organizations that work on climate and environmental issues</li><br>
        <p style="width:60%;">By making small changes in our daily lives and advocating for larger systemic change, we can all play a role in creating a more sustainable and resilient future.</p>
