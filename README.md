Initially there are no countries available, the necessary country databases must be generated by the [FLEX models](https://github.com/H2020-newTRENDs/FLEX) developed by Fraunhofer ISI.
Alternatively, pre-generated databases can be downloaded from [here](). 
The database files must be put into the `db` directory inside the project root.
